10 Threads 
50 seconds delay (1 thread every 5 seconds)
5 times

	Only once (by thread)
		Access to the first repository
		If the test folder exist, then delete the tree.
		Anyway, create the test folder (one by thread)

	Loop 1 (tree depth is not configurable but the elements numbers can)
		Creates a 5 level tree, where every folder in the tree has 2 documents and two subfolders. This sums up to 124 objects by tree.
		In every level the documents created has different sizes, from 100 bytes to 1Mb.
		By level and loop:
			- Creates a folder.
			- Creates a document.
			- Gets the object by path.
			- Gets the object parents.
			- Gets the repository Info.
			- Gets the content stream.
		At the end of each loop, the thread get its tree's descendants. 
	Loop 2
		When each thread ends to build up the tree, then it start to move the objects flattening the tree.

At the end of the test one test folder must exist per thread, with 62 folders and documents as children.
Note: By default the "View results in table" is disabled because it stores all the data sent and received, so the output file would be more than 1Gb.
