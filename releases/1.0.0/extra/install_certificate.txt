Server:
  Save repo.ks in /data/applications/repo/.cert/ folder.
  Uncomment the definition of the https connector in the server.xml configuration file. Add keystoreFile and keystorePass attributes:

  <Connector port="8443" protocol="HTTP/1.1" SSLEnabled="true"
                 maxThreads="150" scheme="https" secure="true"
                 clientAuth="false" sslProtocol="TLS"
                 keystoreFile="/data/applications/repo/.cert/repo.ks"
                 keystorePass="changeit"/>

Client (In the case you are not already trusting in NON-PROD ECAS Certificate Authority):
  JVM
   To connect to the server from java application (like Workbench) you need to install the certificate in the JVM:
   keytool -import -alias repo -file c:\Dev\repo.crt -keystore "c:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.7.0_03\jre\lib\security\cacerts"
   Make sure that paths to cacerts file and repo.crt are correct.

  Firefox
   Firefox will download certificate from server automatically. Open https page (for example: https://serverdev.trade.cec.eu.int:8443/repo/serverAlive.jsp) and accept the certificate.

  Internet Explorer
    Certificate should be installed manually with the following procedure:
    1. Open IE Internet Options, choose Content tab and click Certificates
    2. Choose Trusted Root certification Authorities and click Import
    3. Specify the file to import (repo.crt)
    4. Verify that certificate is stored in Trusted Root Certification Authorities store
    5. Connect to repository thru https to verify the certificate installation
