In order to generate a SSL certificate issued by the NON-PROD ECAS Certificate Authority, go to https://ecast.cc.cec.eu.int:7002/cas/selfCertWeb/ using your ecas test credentials, fill the form and download the .jks file.

If you have renamed the keystore to repo.ks and specified the keystore alais as repo, you can export the certificate from keystore:
keytool -export -alias repo -keystore repo.ks -file repo.crt
