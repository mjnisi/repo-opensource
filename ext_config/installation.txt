Installation, Tomcat 8.5 

This is based on a 'standalone' instance of Tomcat. No manager, no GUI, no web interface.

1) Execute the three SQL-scripts against the database (01_repo_structure.sql, 02_repo_scoreView_oracle.sql and 03_repo_updateAncestorsView_oracle.sql) to create the schema.
2) Unpack the war-file in [CATALINA_HOME]/webapps/[APP_BASE] - where APP_BASE is the name you have chosen for the application
3) Add the four config files (environment.properties, repo_adminConfig.xml, repo_securityConfig.xml and log4j_repo.properties) to [CATALINA_HOME]/webapps/[APP_BASE]/WEB-INF/classes (See later for config)
4) Change paths in log4j_repo.properties (there are 3 of them) to where the log files should be placed.
5) Add your Oracle JDBC driver to either [CATALINA_HOME]/lib or [CATALINA_HOME]/webapps/[APP_BASE]/WEB-INF/lib
6) Start Tomcat. In a standard install the web app can be accessed on http://localhost:8080/[APP_BASE]/

In managed environments 2) and 3) will be different. In any case the three config files must be in the root of the classpath of the web application.

Configuration files
environment.properties - contains general settings.
repo_adminConfig.xml - defines the admin user for the web interface.
repo_securityConfig.xml - defines users and roles.

The config files are documented/commented.
